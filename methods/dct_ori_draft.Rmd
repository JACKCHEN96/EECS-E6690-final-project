## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(corrplot)
library("readxl")

#Import and view Data

#Eliminate missing values
dataset <- read_excel("../data/1415CSM_dataset.xlsx")

#Find correlation between variables.
corrdata <- select(dataset, 5,6,7,10,11,12,13,14)
M <- cor(corrdata)
corrplot(M, method = "number")
#It is evident that there is significant correlation betweeen likes,dislikes and comments.

#Convert relevant variables to factors.
dataset$Sequel = as.factor(dataset$Sequel)
dataset$Genre = as.factor(dataset$Genre)
dataset$Year = as.factor(dataset$Year)

#Prepare data for model. Select features based on the corrplot with minimum corelations between them.
data_model <- select(dataset, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,14)
str(data_model)

#Build model with gorss as the target variable using year, ratings, genre, budget, screens, sequel, sentiment, views and aggregate followers as predictors.
fit <- lm(Gross~.,data = data_model)
summary(fit)

plot(fit)

#The model has an R squared of 66.01%. I would like to further explore ways to increase it.
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
